=head1 NAME

GraphQL - A Perl implementation of L<GraphQL|http://graphql.org/>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use GraphQL qw/:types graphql/;

    ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 EXPORTS

    graphql

    :types

=head1 TYPES

=head2 Object Types and Fields

L<GraphQL::Language::Object>

=head2 Object

Object represents a list of named fields, each of which yield a value of a
specific type.

=item name

=item fields

L</Fields>

=item interfaces

    GraphQLObjectType(
        name => '',
        fields => {
            ...
        },
    );

=head2 Scalar Types

GraphQL provides a number of built‚Äêin scalars, but type systems can add
additional scalars with semantic meaning.

=over

=item * GraphQLBoolean

=item * GraphQLFloat

=item * GraphQLInt

=item * GraphQLID

=item * GraphQLString

=back

L<GraphQL::Language::Scalar>

=head2 Enumeration Types

Enumeration types are a special kind of scalar that is restricted to a
particular set of allowed values.

    GraphQLEnumType(
        name => 'Color',
        values => {
            RED => { value => 0 },
            GREEN => { value => 1 },
            BLUE => { value => 2 },
        },
    );

L<GraphQL::Language::Enum>

=head2 Lists

List modifier marks type as I<List>, which indicates that this field will return
an array of that type.

    GraphQLList($Type);

The L</Non-Null> and L</List> modifiers can be combined.

    GraphQLList(GraphQLNonNull($Type)); # [$Type!]

L<GraphQL::Language::List>

=head2 Non-Null

The Non-Null type modifier means that server always expects to return a
non-null value for a field.
Getting a null value will trigger a GraphQL execution error, letting the client
know that something has gone wrong.

    GraphQLList($Type);

The L</Non-Null> and L</List> modifiers can be combined.

    GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLList($Type)); # [$Type]!

L<GraphQL::Language::NonNull>

=head2 Interfaces

Like many type systems, GraphQL supports interfaces. An Interface is an abstract
type that includes a certain set of fields that a type must include to implement
the interface.

=over

=item name

=item fields

L</Fields>

=item description

=item resolve_type

=back

    GraphQLInterfaceType(
        name => 'Interface',
        fields => {
            ...
        },
    );

L<GraphQL::Language::Interface>

=head2 Union Types

Union types are very similar to interfaces, but they don't get to specify any
common fields between the types.

    GraphQLUnionType(
        name => 'Union',
        types => [$Type0, $Type1],
    );

L<GraphQL::Language::Union>

=head1 SCHEMA

Every GraphQL service has a I<query> type and may or may not have a I<mutation> type.
These types are the same as a regular object type, but they are special because
they define the entry point of every GraphQL query.

    GraphQLSchema(
        query => $Query,
        mutation => $Mutation,
    );

L<GraphQL::Type::Schema>.
